<h1>Homework 6:Part 2 </h1>
<h2>Abby Royle</h2>
<h3>These maps are different representations of the ratio between people 25 or older in Maine with a Bachelors degree
    or higher to the total population. I chose this ratio because I believe that it represents which areas actually have 
    the highest rates of people with a bachlors degree or higher in regards to the population of that county.<h3></h3>

<h3>Mode of Natural Breaks Map</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>This map displays the natural breaks mode of visualization.The pros to this mode are that it showcases the natural areas 
    where the data seperates and where counties are closest in the ratio to eachother. The cons of this is that it does not have 
    an equal distribution of different values in the classes, which can make the gradient skewed to these natural breaks.<h3></h3>

<h3>Mode of Equal Count Quantile Map</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>This map displays the mode of equal count quantile map. This map seems to be the most representative to me because the classes 
    all have an equal distribution of values. The cons of this map are that more counties can be found in one group/color on the gradient
    which can make it more difficult to visualize the differences in values.<h3></h3>

<h3>Mode of Pretty Breaks Map</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>This map displays the pretty breaks mode of visualization. The pros to this mode are that it displays even values of the ratio that make 
    it easier to understand.The cons to this map are that these breaks are not necessarily representative of the distribution of values present in 
    the data. This means that the map may not be the best way to see the ratio of people 25+ with bachelors degrees or higher compared to the population of Maine. <h3></h3>
