    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>In QGIS, I was able to display the map in different projections using the ESRI button on the bottom right 
        of the screen. This allowed me to search a variety of different projections available. I was also able to
        type the ESPG of the map into the search bar to easily find the projection. From there, I simply hit apply, 
        and the map was then shown in the chosen projection. In order to display Tissot's Indicatrix, I added the
        indicatrix plug in to apply to each projection.<p></p>
        </projection>

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Some observations</h3>
    <p>The WGS84 Projection of earth is widely adopted as the standard map. It correctly depicts shape of countries 
        but has distortion closer to the poles (land area). This distortion has caused a Eurocentric view of the world and has caused 
        social and political implications. For example, the map shows Greenland as a very large country, when it is 
        actually a lot smaller in land area.<p></p>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Some observations</h3>
    <p>The Aitoff projection is an equal area projection that correctly showcases the area of countries. This is the pro of 
        using this projection. The cons of using this are that the shapes of countries are distorted near the poles due to the 2D
        model.<p></p>

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
</a>
    <h2>3857 Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>Some observations</h3>
    <p>The Pseudo Mercator projection is one that preserves the shape of countries, and it is well known. Also, at low latitudes, 
        there is little distortion, making it useful for small scale maps. On the other hand, the projection does not correctly represent
        the area of countries, with land near the poles being depicted as larger than it really is.<p></p>

<h2>53018 Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
<h3>Some observations</h3>
<p>The Winkel projection sufficiently represents the relationship between land, size and area. This is beneficial for certain models, 
    especially at the equator where there is little distortion. However, there is significant distortion at the poles, which incorrectly
    displays shape and area.<p></p>

<h2>54034 World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
<h3>Some observations</h3>
<p>This projection shows the equal area of land masses on a map. This is beneficial when looking at the true sizes of countries. The 
    cons of using this map is that the shapes of countries are greatly distorted and innacurately depicts land near the equators. <p></p>

<h2>54027 Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
<h3>Some observations</h3>
<p>The equidistant conic projection is best used for mapping the Northern Hemisphere, as it shows fairly accurate shapes of these
    areas. It gives a more top down view of the world. The cons of using this projection is that it does not correctly depict the Southern Hemisphere and the south pole, as it distorts
    the size and shape of this land. <p></p>

<h2>102016 Equidistant North Pole Azimuthal Projection</h2>
<h3>Some observations</h3>
<p>This projection accurately portrays the distance of a land mass to the poles. The cons of this map projection are that it greatly 
    distorts the shapes and land areas of land masses, which means it is not useful for many mapping needs. <p></p>

<h2>53029 Van Der Grinten Sphere Projection</h2>
<h3>Some observations</h3>
<p>The Van Der Grinten projection has an accurate depiction of land near the equator. It also shows fairly accurate area and shape near these 
    areas. The cons of using this projection are that the shapes and land area around the poles are distorted, making this less useful for mapping
    in these regions.<p></p>

<h2>54046 Craster Parabolic Projection</h2>
<h3>Some observations</h3>
<p>The Craster projection shows the equal area of land, which is useful for assessing qualities in association with area. This map also 
    shows little distortion of shape near the equator, but has significant distortion at the poles.
